            successful analysis of data from more than one participant. After
            this period the dataset and related analysis results will be made

            Yes. By uploading this dataset to OpenNeuro you have to agree to the

            You can apply for up to two 6 month long extensions of the grace
            period. To apply please contact support. We encourage you to publish
            a preprint of your work to reduce the uncertainty of the publishing
            pipeline.

            The mission of OpenNeuro is to incentivize data sharing via
            providing data analysis service. Thus we discourage using it to
            analyze already publicly available datasets. This policy might
            change in the future depending on improvements in analysis cost.

            Yes! OpenNeuro only accepts data in the Brain Imaging Data Structure

            Defacing is strongly preffered over skullstripping, because 
            the process is more robust and yields lower chance of 
            accidentally removing brain tissue.
